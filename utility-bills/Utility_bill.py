# Creates a Utility_bill class. This class has two protected instance
# variables: name and address. The __init__ method takes customerâ€™s
# name and address as two arguments and stores them in the instance
# variables. Adds another protected instance variable total and
# initializes it to 0. Defines two abstract methods calculate_charge
# and display_bill. These abstract methods have no real code.
# There is only one statement to raise a NotImplementedError
# exception.
